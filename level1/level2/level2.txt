Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet. Leave the gun. Take the cannoli. I have a sentimental weakness for my children and I spoil them, as you can see. They talk when they should listen. It's an old habit. I spent my whole life trying not to be careless. Women and children can afford to be careless, but not men. Very well. You want to do business with me. I will do business with you. I see you took the name of the town. What was your father's name?

I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse. My father's name was Antonio Andolini... and this is for you. This one time, this one time I'll let you ask me about my affairs. I'm your older brother, Mike, and I was stepped over!

Do me this favor. I won't forget it. Ask your friends in the neighborhood about me. They'll tell you I know how to return a favor. Mr Corleone is Johnny Fontane's godfather. Now Italians regard that as a very close, a very sacred religious relationship. Just when I thought I was out... they pull me back in. Sonny, please don't do anything. Please don't do anything. You can act like a man!

Never hate your enemies. It affects your judgment. What's wrong with being a lawyer? Hey, listen, I want somebody good - and I mean very good - to plant that gun. I don't want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hands, alright? I want your answer and the money by noon tomorrow. And one more thing. Don't you contact me again, ever. From now on, you deal with Turnbull.
